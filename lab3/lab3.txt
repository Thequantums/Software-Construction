1) i used wget to download the coreutils-8.29.tar.xz from the assignment website. Then i also downloaded the signature file and GNU keyring. when i ran command:gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig. i got a warning
WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

because the key hasnt been varified by the user.
i used the command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
		    wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
		    wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

2)first i had to extract the tar.xz file by running command: tar -xJVF coreutils-8.29.tar.xz. Then i changed directory to the extracted dir by command: cd coreutils-8.29.
when i configure with this directory i got error:
./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/sokchetr/coreutilsinstall
It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run.
make: ***[aclocal.m4] Error 127.
So, i ran command autocoreconf -f -i to fix it.
then i ran command: make and make install.


3) In order to produce the bug, i went to the configured directory.
The ls -aA produces the bug which are "." and "..".
command: cd ~/installcoreutils
	 ls
	 cd ./bin
	 run ls -a -A

4) i copied the patch from Bug#30963 Message #10 into a file called patchfile. We apply the patch using -p1 to the files that need to be modified.
command: cd ~/cs35l/hw3/coreutils-8.29
	 vi patchfile
	 copy and paste the contend from patch online to patchfile
	 save patchfile
	 patch -p1 <patch_file   -p1 used to delete the leading slash

5)In order to build the pathced file, we need to compile all those file that were patched again. The files that werent patched wont need to be compiled again.So, it's faster. That's how the make command works. 
Command: make.

6)i tested the old and new patched ls with the hw3 directory and the test directy which is empty.
command: cd ~/cs35l/hw3
	 ~/coreutilsinstall/bin/ls -a -A   (this is the old version of la)
	 it outputs :
	 .   coreutils-8.29         coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig  lab3.txt       test
	..  coreutils-8.29.tar.xz  gnu-keyring.gpg            .lab3.txt.swp
 	 ~/cs35l/hw3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a -A (this is the new patched version of la)
	it outputs: 
	coreutils-8.29         coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig  lab3.txt       test
	coreutils-8.29.tar.xz  gnu-keyring.gpg            .lab3.txt.swp

	cd ~/test
	         ~/coreutilsinstall/bin/ls -a -A   (this is the old version of la)
	it outputs: .  ..
	~/cs35l/hw3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a -A
	it outputs nothing.
